# Result

```bash
⬢ To-do All done
    ☒ Fix shared_value assignment in Waiting -> Filling transition (line 71)
    ☒ Fix shared_value assignment in Done -> Waiting transition (line 92)

  Perfect! I've implemented the missing code by replacing both todo!() macros with val.shared_value. This ensures that the shared value is properly
  passed through the state transitions:
  1. Line 71: In the Waiting -> Filling transition, the shared_value is now correctly assigned from val.shared_value
  2. Line 92: In the Done -> Waiting transition, the shared_value is now correctly assigned from val.shared_value

  The code should now compile and run without panicking. The state machine will properly maintain the shared value across all state transitions,
  which is essential for the "divide and conquer" pattern where shared functionality is preserved while state-specific behavior changes.
  You can now run cargo run again and the program should execute successfully!

```
